# Mina Recept Page for Lloyds Apotek

We used the HTML5 Boilerplate for this website.

* The development code is in the [`src/`](src) directory.
* The build process relies on [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/).
* The `gulp` tasks can be found in the [`gulpfile.js`](gulpfile.js)
  file.

## Setup

1. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) and
   [`npm`](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm).
2. Run `npm install`.

## Development

You should be able to work almost entirely in the [`src/`](src)
directory.

While developing run `npm run serve` as this will open the website
in your default browser and automatically update it whenever changes
are made to the page or any of the files contained in the page.

## Build

When you have finished your changes, make sure that the distribution
package is correct by running `npm run test` and then checking the
output.
